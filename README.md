# open-and-decentralized-citizenship

A political project based on blockchain concepts and technologies to solve the problems of nation-states,
international-states, tribalism, poltical factionism, and other archaic forms of government. A core idea is that political 
concepts evolve over time, and an honest assessment of the current times requires a new politcal model 
that will meet the needs of an highly advanced technological civilization which humanity will
soon be.

The most logical way to create a new politcal model is using an open source model that encourages 
everyone to participate and benefit. I don't have all the answers, but I have a few ideas. I hope 
you can contribute to this project.

Over the next few decades a few major things will occur that will make the current poltical concepts obsolete. 

First: Improving on current patterns; mobility, urbanization, and IOT(internet of things) will ensure everyone 
on Earth can travel vast distances quickly and communicate with people and things over vast distances instantly. 

Second: Autonomous technologies will make the Working Class obsolete. 

Third: Humans will begin colonizing space in earnest.

Therefore, tying a person's citizenship to their geographic origin of birth is nonsense. The emerging realities compells 
us to expand the concept of citizenship to the entire Earth Solar System or Earth System for short. 
This is a key idea, to establish every person as a citizen of the Earth System with the freedom to live,
work, and pursue all other freedoms independent of where they were born. This will help solve the problems
created by the first and third emerging realities.

The problem of autonomous technologies replacing the Working Class can be solved by converting the 
Working Class into a New Investing Class which will require deep new ideas combined with 
old ideas. To facilitate this, I introduce the Fundamental Rights of Open and 
Decentralized Citizenship:

1) The right to choose open and decentralized citizenship.
2) The right to migrate throughout the Earth System.
3) The right to Universal Property Rights.
4) The right to Universal Basic Healthcare.
5) The right to a Universal Basic Income.

Universal property rights recognize two forms of property:
1) Private
2) Public

Every citizen has the right to own private property, and has the right to access and use public property in a manner
conducive to the public and which does not infringe upon other citizens' rights. For the sustainability of resources, 
most property must remain public property. As an example, imagine that Mars is colonized. To protect the interest of all citizens 
(current  generations and future generations), it would be wise to ensure no one person, sub group of humans, organization, business,
or government or any combination thereof be allowed to gain control over a majority of any area of Mars. Since Mars has not been
colonized yet, it makes sense that Mars is fully public property. To colonize Mars, requires the conversion to private property
of some parts of Mars. 

The conversion of part of Mars and all other celestial bodies as well as Earth Oceans to private property must benefit all citizens,
and serve as a means to implement the Fundamental Rights of Open and Decentralized Citizens. Since a means of creating infrastructure 
and systems to implement those rights will be required, a Serverment in place of a government will act as a decentralized 
aotonomous organization which will recieve a portion of funds created from the conversion of public property to private 
property. All adult citizens will be allowed to vote on all matters of the Serverment. Additional small serverments can be created by vote
to handle local and regional matters. These small serverments will have limited scope and cannot exceed the Serverment.

Residency and identity for voting and other matters involved in day to day life can be established and secured by the Open and Decentralized
Citizenship blockchain to allow the two fold goals of transparency and privacy required in a free society. Ultimately, the fulfillment of
this blockchain will ensure every citizen prosperity and ensure no centralized authority or person can impose itsself on others.
