# open-and-decentralized-citizenship

Political concepts evolve over time, and an honest assessment of the current times requires a new politcal model 
that will meet the needs of a highly advanced technological civilization which humanity will
soon be.

The most logical way to create a new politcal model is using an open source model that encourages 
everyone to participate and benefit. I don't have all the answers, but I have a few ideas. I hope 
you can contribute to this project. Just fork the repository to begin.

## The Future Taking Shape
Over the next few decades a few major things will occur that will make the current poltical concepts obsolete. 

First: Improving on current patterns; mobility, urbanization, and IOT(internet of things) will ensure everyone 
on Earth can travel vast distances quickly just as we can already communicate with people and things over vast distances instantly. 

Second: Autonomous technologies will make the Working Class obsolete. 

## The Fundamental Rights of Open and Decentralized citizens are:
1) The right to choose citizenship.
2) The right to migrate and live anywhere in the Earth System.
3) The right to Universal Property Rights.
4) The right to Universal Basic Healthcare.
5) The right to a Universal Basic Income. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHnbD6ACRM9krfWOZEqclIW3k8bvImPZON6zhZVMBu4/edit?usp=sharing
6) The right to vote by direct democracy.

## Forward Looking Ideas
Universal property rights recognize two forms of property:
1) Private
2) Public

Every citizen has the right to own private property, and has the right to access and use public property in a manner
conducive to the public and which does not infringe upon other citizens' rights. For the sustainability of resources, 
most property must remain public property. As an example, imagine that Mars is colonized. To protect the interest of all citizens 
(current  generations and future generations), it would be wise to ensure no one person, sub group of humans, organization, business,
or government or any combination thereof be allowed to gain control over a majority of any area of Mars. Since Mars has not been
colonized yet, it makes sense that Mars is fully public property. To colonize Mars, requires the conversion to private property
of some parts of Mars. 

The conversion of part of Mars and all other celestial bodies as well as Earth Oceans to private property must benefit all citizens,
and serve as a means to implement the Fundamental Rights of Open and Decentralized Citizens. Since a means of creating infrastructure 
and systems to implement those rights will be required, a Serverment in place of a government will act as a decentralized 
autonomous organization which will recieve a portion of funds created from the conversion of public property to private 
property. All adult citizens will be allowed to vote on all matters of the Serverment. Additional small serverments can be created by vote
to handle local and regional matters. These small serverments will have limited scope and cannot exceed the Serverment.

Residency and identity for voting and other matters involved in day to day life can be established and secured by the Open and Decentralized
Citizenship blockchain to allow the two fold goals of transparency and privacy required in a free society. Ultimately, the fulfillment of
this blockchain will ensure every citizen prosperity and ensure no centralized authority or person can impose itsself on others.

Universal Basic Income (UBI) in a Highly Advanced Technological Civilization (HATC) refers to an amout sufficient to provide a comfortable 
lifestyle in such a civilization. Different amounts for a UBI have been debated by theorist such as $1000/month(US Dollar). However, 
that amount would be equivilent to living in poverty in the developed world; therefore, it would be far below a comfortable 
lifestyle. To clarify a fair UBI, the term Standard Universal Basic
 Income (SUBI) refers to the amount of an UBI for one person/year. 
A SUBI = $12000 US Dollars is too low. A fair amount for a HTAC would be equivilent to the approximate per person GDP of the United
States. Therefore, for the near future of ten to twenty years, A SUBI = $60000 US Dollar is recommended. 

This is just one idea for a universal basic income. See the link to SUBI Token concept here for another: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHnbD6ACRM9krfWOZEqclIW3k8bvImPZON6zhZVMBu4/edit?usp=sharing

Since the conversion of public property to private property for space colonization and enterprise has already been established
along with the concept that all current property off of Earth is public property, the conversion of property and creation of the 
first ten to twenty years of SUBI for each citizen can be linked by transferring an amount of land on Mars and the Earth Moon to 
private ownership. Each citizen will own that land as private owners and they can sale or trade to obtain a value equal to 10 years of 
SUBI. This is one way to create income and wealth for citizens. 

Another way going forward to create income for citizens is through selling mining rights for asteroids. 

Whatever the case, only a small portion of the Earth Moon, Mars and its moons, and the local asteroid belt may be leased, sold, or , otherwise,
converted to private property over the next 10-30 years to ensure future citizens have equal access to opportunities, etc. In fact, the Earth System 
can be divided into zones:

1) Earth Zone: Earth and its Moon and local space.
2) Inner Zone: The Sun, Mercury, and Venus and local space.
3) Mars Zone: Mars and its moons and the asteroid belt and local space.
4) Jupiter Zone: Jupiter and its moons and local space.
5) Outer Zone: Saturn, Neptune, Uranus and their moons and local space. 
6) Perimeter Zone: All planets, planetoids, asteroids, and local space. 
7) Ethereal Zone: Comets, asteroids, etc. that pass through any zone but are not contained within the zone constantly.

Between now and 2050-2070, most colonization and enterprise will likely be concentrated in the Earth Zone and Mars Zone. That should 
inform the conversion of public to private property. The real question is how long will it take to develop space based colonies with 
current technology and rate of exponential improvement. Space colonization along with the enterprise and industry it creates will fund 
the remaining progress of the Earth economy so that all citizens are part of a HATC. The risks and benefits of space colonization will drive 
the development of space assets and provide dreamers, explorers, seekers, and scientist with fertile places to expand human civilization.

As this new citizenship structure is put in place, the Working Class must be converted to a New Investing Class to fully realise a future of wealth 
and income equality. Citizens will use their SUBI, cryptocurrency, and autonomous technologies to create fortunes and the ability to live a
cultured and hyper mobile lifestyle anywhere on Earth and beyond if they so choose. The ideas of central authorities, autocrats, and governments will 
melt away.
